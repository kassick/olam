real, parameter :: resp_opt_water = 0.94  !  Optimal soil porosity, as a fraction of total porosity, for heterotrophic respiration (dimensionless).
real, parameter :: resp_water_below_opt = 4.96  ! Determines rate at which heterotrophic respiration declines for relative porosities below resp_opt_water (dimensionless).
real, parameter :: resp_water_above_opt = 4.88  ! Determines rate at which heterotrophic respiration declines for relative porosities above resp_opt_water (dimensionless).
real, parameter :: resp_temperature_increase = 0.0741  ! Determines how rapidly heterotrophic respiration increases with increasing temperature (1/K).

real, parameter :: N_immobil_supply_scale = 40.0 / 365.25! Supply coefficient for nitrogen immobilization (1/day)

real, parameter :: cwd_frac = 0.2  ! Fraction of structural material that goes to coarse woody debris upon mortality.  Note that currently CWD decomposed at a rate identical to structural soil C.

real, parameter :: r_fsc=1.0   ! Fraction of structural pool decomposition going to heterotrophic respiration

real, parameter :: r_stsc=0.3  ! Fraction of structural pool decomposition going to heterotrophic respiration instead of the slow pool.

real, parameter :: r_ssc=1.0   ! Fraction of structural pool decomposition going to heterotrophic respiration

real, parameter :: K1=4.5 / 365.25 ! Intrinsic decay rate of fast pool soil carbon (1/days); this is modulated by Lc

real, parameter :: K3=100.2 / 365.25 ! Intrinsic decay rate of slow pool soil carbon (1/days).  This pool has already decayed from the structural pool.
