! Suppose you want to run ED only at a few scattered test sites.  These are called sites of interest (SOIs).  max_soi is the maximum allowable.
integer, parameter :: max_soi = 10
integer :: n_soi  ! n_soi is the actual number of SOIs from OLAMIN.
real, dimension(max_soi) :: soi_lat  ! latitude (-90:90) of each SOI
real, dimension(max_soi) :: soi_lon  ! longitude (-180:180) of each SOI

! Suppose you want to run ED for a few rectangular regions.  You can run for a global region, if you want.  You can also run several sub-global regions and several SOIs.  The maximum number of regions is max_ed_regions.
